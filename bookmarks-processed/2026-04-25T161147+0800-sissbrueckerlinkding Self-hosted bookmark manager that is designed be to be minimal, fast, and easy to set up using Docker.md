## Introduction

linkding is a bookmark manager that you can host yourself. It's designed be to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up using Docker.

The name comes from:

- *link* which is often used as a synonym for URLs and bookmarks in common language
- *Ding* which is German for thing
- ...so basically something for managing your links

**Feature Overview:**

- Clean UI optimized for readability
- Organize bookmarks with tags
- Bulk editing, Markdown notes, read it later functionality
- Share bookmarks with other users or guests

- Automatically archive websites, either as local HTML file or on Internet Archive
- Import and export bookmarks in Netscape HTML format
- Installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Extensions for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/linkding-extension/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkding-extension/beakmhbijpdhipnjhnclmhgjlddhidpe), as well as a bookmarklet
- SSO support via OIDC or authentication proxies

## Getting Started

The following links help you to get started with linkding:

- [Install linkding on your own server](https://linkding.link/installation) or [check managed hosting options](https://linkding.link/managed-hosting)
- [Install the browser extension](https://linkding.link/browser-extension)
- [Check out community projects](https://linkding.link/community), which include mobile apps, browser extensions, libraries and more

## Documentation

The full documentation is now available at [linkding.link](https://linkding.link/).

If you want to contribute to the documentation, you can find the source files in the `docs` folder.

If you want to contribute a community project, feel free to [submit a PR](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/edit/master/docs/src/content/docs/community.md).

## Contributing

Small improvements, bugfixes and documentation improvements are always welcome. If you want to contribute a larger feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it. I may choose to ignore PRs for features that don't align with the project's goals or that I don't want to maintain.

## Development

The application is built using the Django web framework. You can get started by checking out the excellent [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/). The `bookmarks` folder contains the actual bookmark application. Other than that the code should be self-explanatory / standard Django stuff 🙂.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Node.js

### Setup

Initialize the development environment with:

```
make init
```

This sets up a virtual environment using uv, installs NPM dependencies and runs migrations to create the initial database.

Create a user for the frontend:

```
uv run manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```

Run the frontend build for bundling frontend components with:

```
make frontend
```

Then start the Django development server with:

```
make serve
```

The frontend is now available under [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

### Tests

Run all tests with pytest:

```
make test
```

### Linting

Run linting with ruff:

```
make lint
```

### Formatting

Format Python code with ruff, Django templates with djlint, and JavaScript code with prettier:

```
make format
```

### DevContainers

This repository also supports DevContainers:

Once checked out, only the following commands are required to get started:

Create a user for the frontend:

```
uv run manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```

Start the Node.js development server (used for compiling JavaScript components like tag auto-completion) with:

```
make frontend
```

Start the Django development server with:

```
make serve
```

The frontend is now available under [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
